# ImageEffectFilter
Android image filter processing using layer drawable and effect factory android.

Choose Effect Factory if you want select effect from effect factory from Android (Use minimum API 14).
Choose layer drawable if want use 2 stacked drawable to create effect, this is using layer drawable. For future sample development I want to create effect with GPUImage Pricessing library, keep in touch.
